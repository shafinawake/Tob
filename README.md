Tob, an image processing based diseases detection web-based solutions for gardeners. Gardener doesn't cultivate like farmers so affording technologies to detect diseases is costly. So, to make it easy for gardeners to detect diseases I've created a web-based image processing solution for them. 

In this website gardeners will be able to upload an image of plant and analyzing the image the gardener will get the result whether that plant is affected by any form of diseases or not. 

Here I've uploaded almost every file form Jupyter Notebook to the web-interface except the venv(environment) file.
